# Project: Minesweeper

## Outline

Create a simplified version of Minesweeper to be played on the Command Line using Java. Objective was to create a 10x10 grid with 10 bombs that a user can move through and find the bombs, unlike the original game, there's no flagging a bomb, however you will be told how many bombs are around a particular spot with the numbers 1-8. Empty space wil be also open up. Once the game is over you can select y/n to play again or leave.
This was my first project in Java which came with some difficulties, I spent a lot more time debugging than in previous projects and it usually came down to something simple like not casing a type.

## Stack

- Java

## MVP

- 10x10 array, it was suggested to use a 2d array, but it was out choice.
- User will be able to enter a command that selects coordinates on the grid.
- Render the grid everytime a selection has been made.
- If the user selects a bomb, Game Over.
- Must have the option to play again.

## Updates to make

- I would love to add the option of Flags.
- Need to check out some animations for the reveal of empty space.
- Add an option to have a bigger grid with more bombs.
- Add colors to cli.
